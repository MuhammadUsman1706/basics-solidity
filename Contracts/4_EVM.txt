EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) is the standard on how to deploy smart contracts on ethereum, like blockchains.

Any blockchain that implements EVM, you can deploy your smart contracts in solidity.

Some EVM compatible platforms: Avalanche, Fantom, Polygon. We can deploy our code to these blockchains.
