Six places you can store data in solidity: Stack, memory, storage, calldata, code, logs

memory and calldata are temporary variables and exists in the lifetime of a function only, whereas storage variables exists even outside of a function

if not explicitly defined, it is a storage variable

calldata can't be modified while memory can be modified

we need to mention the type in array, structs and strings (because they are iterable)
